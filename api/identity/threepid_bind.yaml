      summary: Bind a user's Matrix ID to a 3PID.
      description: |
        After a 3PID session has been successfully validated, a Matrix User ID can
        be bound to a 3PID by calling this API and providing the session credentials.

        If the session is still valid, this will publish the association between the
        3PIDs validated on that session and the passed Matrix user ID. Future calls
        to ``/lookup`` for any of the session's 3PIDs will return this association.
