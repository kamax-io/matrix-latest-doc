Push Gateway API
================

Clients may want to receive push notifications when events are received at
the homeserver. This is managed by a distinct entity called the Push Gateway.

Specification version
---------------------

This version of the specification is generated from
`matrix-doc <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc>`_ as of Git commit
`{{git_version}} <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/tree/{{git_rev}}>`_.

Overview
--------

A client's homeserver forwards information about received events to the push
gateway. The gateway then submits a push notification to the push notification
provider (e.g. APNS, GCM).

Homeserver behaviour
--------------------

This describes the format used by "HTTP" pushers to send notifications of
events to Push Gateways. If the endpoint returns an HTTP error code, the
homeserver SHOULD retry for a reasonable amount of time using exponential backoff.
